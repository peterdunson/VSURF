\title{A simulated dataset called toys data}
\format{
The format is a list of 2 components:

\describe{
 \item{x}{a dataframe containing input variables: with 100 obs. of 200
variables}
 \item{y}{output variable: a factor with 2 levels "-1" and "1"}
 }
}

\description{
\code{toys} is a simple simulated dataset of a binary classification
problem, introduced by Weston et.al..
}
\details{
It is an equiprobable two class problem, Y belongs to \{-1,1\}, with six
true  variables, the others being some noise.
The simulation model is defined through the conditional distribution
of the \eqn{X_i} for Y=y:

\itemize{
 \item with probability 0.7, X^j ~ N(yj,1) for j=1,2,3 and
X^j ~ N(0,1) for j=4,5,6 ;

 \item with probability 0.3, X^j ~ N(0,1) for j=1,2,3 and
X^j ~ N(y(j-3),1) for j=4,5,6 ;

 \item the other variables are noise, X^j ~ N(0,1)
for j=7,\dots,p.
}

After simulation, the obtained variables are finally standardized.
